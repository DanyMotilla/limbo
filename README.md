## Features

- **Dual Lattice Modes**:
  - Surface Lattice: Creates patterns that follow the object's surface
  - Volume Lattice: Fills the entire interior with a gyroid pattern

- **Customizable Parameters**:
  - Pattern Scale: Control cell size and density (0.5 to 10.0)
  - Pattern Thickness: Adjust wall thickness (0.05 to 0.5)
  - Resolution: Balance between quality and processing speed (20 to 100)

- **Smart Processing**:
  - Automatic mesh simplification for large models
  - Memory-efficient chunked processing
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Robust error handling

## Technical Details

### Surface Mode Implementation

- Uses signed distance field approach for continuous surfaces
- Adaptive surface thickness for better detail
- Smart dilation/erosion for hollow shell generation
- Resolution automatically adjusted for surface quality

### Memory Optimization

- Chunked processing for both containment and gyroid generation
- Efficient numpy array operations
- Automatic garbage collection of intermediate results

## API Documentation

### Endpoints

#### POST /generate_gyroid
Generate a gyroid lattice structure from an STL file.

**Parameters:**
- `stl_file`: STL file (multipart/form-data)
  - Maximum vertices: 1,000,000
- `mode`: String ("surface" or "volume")
- `period`: Float (0.5 to 10.0) - Controls cell size
- `thickness`: Float (0.05 to 0.5) - Controls wall thickness
- `resolution`: Integer (20 to 100) - Controls mesh quality

**Response:**
```json
{
    "job_id": "uuid-string"
}
```

**Resource Limits:**
- Maximum input mesh size: 1,000,000 vertices
- Maximum output mesh size: 1,000,000 vertices
- Maximum memory usage: 50% of system RAM
- Maximum resolution: 100

#### GET /job/{job_id}
Check the status of a gyroid generation job.

**Response:**
```json
{
    "id": "uuid-string",
    "status": "pending|processing|completed|failed",
    "progress": 0.0 to 1.0,
    "result_file": "path/to/file.stl",
    "error": null
}
```

The `progress` field provides real-time feedback on the generation process:
- 0.0-0.4: Initial setup and mesh loading
- 0.4-0.6: Containment analysis
- 0.6-0.9: Gyroid pattern generation
- 0.9-1.0: Final mesh processing and export

#### GET /job/{job_id}/result
Download the generated STL file.

## Usage Tips

1. **Surface Lattice Mode**:
   - Best for creating textured surfaces
   - Use lower thickness values for delicate patterns
   - Higher resolution gives smoother surface detail
   - Recommended for decorative purposes

2. **Volume Lattice Mode**:
   - Ideal for lightweight internal structures
   - Adjust pattern scale to control cell density
   - Balance between strength and weight reduction
   - Perfect for functional parts

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Start with lower resolution (40-60) for quick previews
   - For large models, the system will automatically simplify the mesh
   - Monitor memory usage when processing complex models
   - Consider splitting very large models into smaller parts

## Configuration

- **Backend Settings**:
  - Default port: 8000
  - Maximum workers: 4
  - Memory monitoring enabled
  - CORS enabled for development

- **Frontend Settings**:
  - Development port: 5173
  - API retry attempts: 3
  - Progress polling interval: 1s

## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Invalid input files
- Memory exhaustion
- Network issues
- Processing failures
- Invalid surface generation

## Known Limitations

- Maximum recommended input mesh size: 1 million faces
- Surface mode requires minimum resolution of 80 for quality results
- Memory usage scales with resolutionÂ³
